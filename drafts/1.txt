# One-Party Socialist Leadership Can Also Be Inefficient

## Abstract

Over the recent years, it has been evident that China is making a great success for its rise, or "The Great Renaissance of the Chinese Nation" in the propaganda of CPC. Meanwhile, some voices are out there praising the efficiency of the Chinese government, and some among them are trying to imply that the inefficiency roots in the bipartisan electoral system of the United States, or multi-party electoral systems in other western democracies. It is extremely dangerous to our democracy; we the people of the western democracies should not let a few years of achievements charm our eyes. Through careful investigation, we have concluded in this article that the efficiency of a government does has no absolute causal relationship with whether the electoral system is socialist one-party system or capitalist multi-party system. It is groundless to pretend as if there is any of such relationship; it is neither supported by historical experience or theoretical study.
