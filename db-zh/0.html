<p>Over the recent years, in spite of difficulties in increasing social unrest and weaker economic growth, it has been evident that China is overall successful during its rise, or "The Great Renaissance of the Chinese Nation" in the propaganda of CPC, although it remains questionable whether will its rise be as peaceful as the Chinese government says. Meanwhile, some voices are out there praising the efficiency of the Chinese government, and some among them are trying to imply that the inefficiency roots in the bipartisan electoral system of the United States, or multi-party electoral systems in other western democracies. It is extremely dangerous to our democracy if the rumors continue to devastate the faith in our constitution and democracy; we the people of the western democracies should not let a few years of achievements charm our eyes.</p>

<p>Through careful investigation, we have concluded in this article that the efficiency of a government has no absolute causal relationship with whether the electoral system is a socialist one-party system or capitalist multi-party system. It is groundless to pretend as if there is any such relationship; the argument is supported by neither historical experience nor theoretical study.</p>

<h3>效率的迷思</h3>

<p>「评价政府的维度不仅仅是民主」，许多亲中派的经济学家（例如 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_China_Rules_the_World" target="_blank">Martin Jacques</a>）总是如此向我们强调。但是，同样的标准也应适用于效率——评价政府的维度不仅仅是效率。</p>

<h3>现代中国的低效史</h3>

<p>Inefficiency is a common phenomenon, rather than a feature of the West. It can happen in the United States, in Europe, in Africa; it can also happen in China. Envisioning China as a place of unmatchable efficiency and zero corruption is only a fantasy, but unfortunately, the fantasy has been adopted by a lot of people.</p>

<h3>西方特色的现代化道路</h3>

<p>As we gradually shift into a world which is becoming more China-led and less West-led, as we gradually get used to living with the new circumstances, a mission remains important — to retain our western identity and western heritage as we keep modernizing. Some predicted that, as we continue to modernize, we will inevitably easternize, as same as China and Japan did westernize, more or less, during their initial modernization.</p>

<p>But what we must understand is that China and Japan did not comprehensively westernize; they unarguably retained their eastern identity and eastern heritages, although they did relinquish a lot of eastern traditions meanwhile. Westerners are no inferior to the Chinese; if they can retain their eastern identity, so can we.</p>

<p>We the westerners must choose our paths wisely. Eastern “cosmopolitan ideas” must be evaluated with caution, and eastern “successful policies” must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis before adoption. CPC itself endured the bitter of taking foreign instructions without combining with their local reality during its initial expansion before World War Ⅱ; if we are to learn from China, we should learn this part first.</p>

<p>我们西方文明既不能走帝国主义的老路，也不能走社会主义的邪路；我们必须从我们自己的历史中发现未来的可能性，必须探索我们自己的前进道路。我们时常需要学习中国，但我们永远是我们自己。</p>
